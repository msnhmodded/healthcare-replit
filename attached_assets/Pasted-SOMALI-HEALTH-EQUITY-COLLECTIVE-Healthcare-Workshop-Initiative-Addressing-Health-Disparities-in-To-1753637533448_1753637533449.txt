SOMALI HEALTH EQUITY COLLECTIVE 
Healthcare Workshop Initiative: Addressing Health Disparities in Toronto's Somali Community
Project Lead: Ifrah Ismail
Date: July 2025
Timeline: July 2025 - January 2026

SUMMARY

Toronto's Somali community has significant health challenges extending far beyond individual lifestyle choices. The research consistently shows higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health struggles within our community. Fueled by the intersection of immigration experience, economic barriers, and a healthcare system that often fails to understand our needs. The Somali Health Equity Collaborative emerges from this reality with a straightforward goal: to bridge the gap between healthcare providers and community members through education that is relevant and meaningful in our daily lives. Rather than another top-down health program, this initiative centers community voices and builds on existing strengths within Somali neighbourhoods across Toronto. Working in partnership with Abu Hurairah Centre and Khalid bin Waleed Centre, we're developing workshops that address real concerns people have about managing chronic diseases, navigating the healthcare system, and dealing with the stress that comes from being misunderstood by medical professionals. Our approach recognizes that effective health education must occur in accessible and community-centred spaces. Spaces where people feel comfortable and from voices they trust. The project comprises three main goals: regular workshops that deliver educational material, an advocacy toolkit, and a digital platform providing ongoing access to reliable health information. Attendance numbers do not just measure success, but also participants' increased confidence in advocating for their health needs and their connections to appropriate care. This work aligns with broader conversations about health equity in Ontario while providing concrete tools that Somali families can use immediately. By December 2025, we anticipate having served over 200 community members and established a sustainable model that other communities can adapt for their contexts.


PROJECT BACKGROUND AND COMMUNITY CONTEXT

Understanding Health Disparities Contextually
When we discuss health disparities affecting Somali families in Toronto, a significant challenge is that many community members struggle to accept new diagnoses and find it difficult to change long-established habits and routines. Even when individuals receive clear diagnoses for conditions like diabetes or heart disease, there's often resistance to accepting these conditions as part of their health reality. This difficulty with acceptance frequently leads people to continue with familiar dietary patterns, physical activity levels, and daily routines rather than making the significant lifestyle changes that managing chronic conditions requires. Many families express that changing traditional foods, meal timing, or social eating practices feels like losing important cultural connections. The challenge is compounded by healthcare navigation barriers in Ontario's system, where patients are expected to advocate for themselves and follow complex treatment regimens. Language barriers persist even with interpretation services, particularly when medical concepts don't translate directly into cultural understanding of health and illness. Cultural factors around privacy also play a role, especially regarding mental health concerns. When depression or anxiety go untreated due to stigma, this often makes it even harder for individuals to find the motivation and energy needed to accept diagnoses and make lifestyle changes for conditions like diabetes. Healthcare providers sometimes struggle to understand Islamic practices around fasting, prayer times, or dietary restrictions, leading to treatment recommendations that feel disconnected from daily life. This disconnect makes it easier for community members to dismiss or minimize their diagnoses rather than work toward sustainable behavior change.
Community Assets 
Despite these challenges, Toronto's Somali community possesses significant assets that this project builds upon. Islamic centers serve as trusted gathering spaces where health education can reach families who may not have access to traditional healthcare settings. Community leaders, particularly women who often make family health decisions, have developed informal networks for sharing health information and supporting one another through medical challenges. Religious frameworks around health and wellness provide essential foundations for preventive care education. Islamic principles that emphasize the importance of caring for one's body align well with medical recommendations regarding diet, exercise, and stress management. Rather than seeing religion as a barrier to health education, our approach recognizes these shared values as starting points for meaningful health conversations. Existing community organizations have developed expertise in cultural navigation and advocacy that directly applies to healthcare contexts. Settlement agencies understand the practical challenges immigrants face in accessing services, while women's groups have created safe spaces for discussing sensitive health topics. This project leverages these existing relationships rather than trying to build entirely new networks.

WORKSHOP APPROACH AND EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY

Person-Centred Education
Our workshop design starts from the premise that community members are experts on their own lives and health experiences. Rather than lecturing about what people should do, sessions begin by understanding the actual barriers families face in managing their health. This means creating space for real questions about medication costs, concerns about side effects, or confusion about conflicting health advice from different sources. Diabetes education, for example, goes beyond explaining blood sugar management to address why families might be skeptical about medical recommendations. We've heard community members express concerns about becoming dependent on medications or worry that doctors prescribe too many pills without understanding their full impact. These aren't unreasonable concerns, and our educational approach acknowledges them while providing accurate information that helps people make informed decisions. Mental health education acknowledges the cultural complexity surrounding discussions of emotional well-being. Rather than pushing Western therapy models, workshops explore how mental health connects to physical health, particularly in managing chronic diseases. We discuss practical strategies for managing stress and isolation while respecting cultural values surrounding family privacy and community support. Cardiovascular health education is integrated with diabetes management, as these conditions often co-occur in our community. Sessions address practical questions about modifying traditional foods to support heart health, finding culturally appropriate exercise options, and communicating effectively with cardiologists and other specialists who may not be familiar with Somali cultural contexts.

Collaborative Learning Model
Each workshop brings together community members with healthcare professionals who have experience serving diverse populations. This isn't about medical experts talking to passive audiences, but instead facilitated conversations where community knowledge and medical expertise inform each other. Healthcare providers learn about the barriers families face, while community members gain insights into how medical recommendations can be integrated into their daily lives. Sessions include time for participants to share strategies they've developed for managing health challenges. Often, community members have found creative solutions to medication management, dietary modifications, or navigating healthcare that could benefit others facing similar situations. This peer learning component recognizes that health education is most effective when it occurs through community networks rather than one-way information transfer.


Addressing Misinformation and Building Trust
Healthcare misinformation circulates rapidly through social media and community networks, often filling gaps left by inadequate communication from healthcare providers. Rather than dismissing community concerns as ignorance, our approach addresses the underlying reasons why misinformation feels more trustworthy than official medical advice. Trust-building requires acknowledging that healthcare systems have historically failed many immigrant and racialized communities. When community members express skepticism about medical recommendations, they're often drawing on real experiences of discrimination or inadequate care. Educational sessions create space for discussing these experiences while providing tools for advocating for better care within existing systems.

DIGITAL PLATFORM AND RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT

Website Design 
The Somali Health Equity Collaborative website adheres to the accessible and welcoming design approach employed by organizations such as the Ontario Council for International Cooperation. This means clean, modern layouts that prioritize content over decoration, with bright, optimistic colours that feel inviting rather than clinical. The design emphasizes connections between people and the community, rather than abstract medical concepts. Navigation remains intentionally simple with clear sections for Workshop Information, Health Resources, Community Stories, and How to Get Involved. The homepage design features photographs of diverse community members engaged in health education and advocacy, immediately signalling that this platform centers on real people's experiences rather than generic medical information. Colour choices reflect accessibility principles, featuring high contrast between text and backgrounds to ensure readability for users with varying vision abilities. The palette employs warm, energetic tones that convey growth and possibility, rather than the sterile blues and whites often associated with medical websites. Typography selections prioritize clarity across languages, with adequate spacing and sizing for comfortable reading on mobile devices.

Inclusive Visual Design
Rather than attempting to represent specifically Somali or Islamic aesthetics, the visual design emphasizes inclusivity and community connection. Photography showcases diverse families in everyday settings - cooking together, attending community events, and participating in physical activities - that anyone can relate to, regardless of their specific cultural background. Graphic elements use simple, clean lines and shapes that support content clarity rather than competing for attention. Icons and illustrations maintain cultural neutrality while communicating their intended functions. This approach ensures the platform feels welcoming to community members while also being accessible to healthcare providers, family members, or community partners who might need to access resources.

Mobile-First Functionality
Understanding that most community members access online resources through smartphones, the platform prioritizes mobile functionality in every design decision. Touch-friendly button sizes, simplified forms, and optimized loading times ensure smooth user experiences regardless of device type or internet connection speed. Language switching between English and Somali maintains the user's position within the content, preventing the frustration of having to re-navigate after changing languages. Forms for workshop registration use clear, simple language with helpful explanations for any technical terms that might be unfamiliar to community members.

COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION

Abu Hurairah Centre Partnership
The partnership with Abu Hurairah Centre recognizes this space as a central gathering point for many Somali families, particularly on Fridays, when community attendance is at its peak. Rather than scheduling separate health events, workshops are integrated into existing community rhythms by occurring after evening prayers, when families are already present and engaged with their community. This partnership extends beyond venue provision to include collaborative program development. Community leaders help identify health topics that reflect current concerns and provide cultural guidance on how to discuss sensitive health issues respectfully and appropriately; their endorsement signals to community members that health advocacy aligns with Islamic values and community priorities. The partnership includes plans for ongoing collaboration beyond the initial workshop series. Abu Hurairah Centre's commitment to annual health programming ensures sustainability while allowing content to evolve based on emerging community needs and feedback from previous sessions.

Khalid bin Waleed Centre Women's Programming
Recognizing that many health topics require gender-specific discussion spaces, the partnership with Khalid bin Waleed Centre focuses on creating comfortable environments for women to discuss reproductive health, mental health, and chronic disease management without cultural barriers that might exist in mixed-gender settings. Saturday evening programming allows for participation without conflicting with family responsibilities or work schedules, which often limit women's ability to attend weekday events. The partnership includes childcare provisions and flexible scheduling that accommodate the realities of family life for many Somali women. This collaboration particularly addresses health topics that affect women disproportionately, including postpartum depression, diabetes during pregnancy, and the intersection of mental health with chronic disease management. Educational content acknowledges the particular stresses that Somali women face as they often manage both their own health needs and coordinate healthcare for their families.

Expanding Partnership Networks
Beyond these primary partnerships, the project also involves collaboration with settlement agencies, community health centers, and other organizations that serve Somali families. These partnerships provide referral pathways for workshop participants who require additional support, helping to ensure that health education is connected to broader resources that address the social determinants of health. Healthcare provider partnerships focus on connecting community members with culturally competent care rather than simply increasing healthcare utilization. This means working with providers who demonstrate an understanding of cultural and religious considerations in treatment planning and who communicate effectively across language barriers.

EVALUATION APPROACH AND COMMUNITY ACCOUNTABILITY

Measuring What Matters to Community Members
Evaluation design centers outcomes that community members identify as important rather than focusing solely on metrics that satisfy academic or funding requirements. While we track attendance and knowledge acquisition, we're equally interested in whether participants feel more confident advocating for their health needs and whether they've been able to access appropriate care following workshop participation. Pre- and post-assessments include questions about healthcare navigation confidence, understanding of health conditions, and comfort level in communicating with healthcare providers. However, these quantitative measures complement rather than replace qualitative feedback about whether workshops addressed participants' actual concerns and provided valuable tools for their daily lives. A follow-up evaluation conducted three months after the workshops focuses on whether participants have successfully implemented the health management strategies discussed and whether they've encountered any barriers that could inform future programming. This longer-term perspective acknowledges that behaviour change occurs gradually and that genuine health improvement necessitates sustained support, rather than one-time educational events.

Community Feedback Integration
Evaluation includes regular feedback collection from community partners regarding the program's relevance and cultural appropriateness. This ensures that workshops continue reflecting community priorities rather than external assumptions about what Somali families need to learn about health management. Participant feedback mechanisms include both formal surveys and informal conversation opportunities during workshop sessions. Community members often share their most honest feedback in casual conversations rather than on formal evaluation forms, so creating multiple opportunities for input helps capture a more comprehensive picture of program effectiveness.

Resource development includes creating materials that families can use beyond workshop participation, recognizing that health education extends into daily life through ongoing reference materials and tools for healthcare advocacy.

AUGUST PRESENTATION OVERVIEW

Demonstrating a Community-Centred Approach
The August 10th presentation highlights how this project stems from genuine community needs rather than external assumptions about what Somali families need. Presentation components include community needs assessment findings that inform program priorities and demonstrate responsive rather than prescriptive program development. The comprehensive toolkit represents a tangible resource that extends impact beyond workshop participation. Developed using successful models from organizations like the Ontario Council for International Cooperation, the toolkit provides practical tools for healthcare advocacy, system navigation, and health management that families can adapt to their specific circumstances. The website demonstration illustrates how digital resources facilitate ongoing community engagement while ensuring accessibility across varying levels of technology comfort. The platform offers workshop registration, resource downloads, and connections to healthcare resources, while prioritizing user experience design that accommodates community members' actual technology access and usage patterns. Community partnership documentation demonstrates genuine community endorsement through formal agreements with Abu Hurairah Centre and Khalid bin Waleed Centre. These partnerships extend beyond venue provision to include collaborative program development and ongoing commitment to community health education.

Evidence-Based Programming Framework
The presentation includes an explanation of the methodology that situates this project within the broader context of health equity research, while maintaining a focus on practical community applications. The educational approach draws from community health promotion best practices, adapting these frameworks to reflect Somali cultural contexts and community-identified priorities. The evaluation framework demonstrates accountability to both community members and potential funders through a mixed-methods assessment that captures both quantitative outcomes and qualitative feedback on program relevance and cultural appropriateness. Long-term evaluation involves tracking healthcare resource utilization and changes in health outcomes, which individuals access through partnerships with healthcare providers.

Sustainability and Replication Planning
Program sustainability extends beyond funding considerations to include community ownership, development, and integration with existing community organization activities. The presentation addresses volunteer recruitment, community member training as peer educators, and partnership maintenance strategies that ensure the continuation of programming, regardless of external funding availability. Replication potential addresses adaptation possibilities for other communities facing similar healthcare access barriers while respecting the specific cultural and contextual factors that shape health experiences within different immigrant communities. Program documentation facilitates knowledge sharing while avoiding assumptions that identical approaches will be practical across diverse community contexts. The Somali Health Equity Collaborative represents a comprehensive approach to health education that centers community voices while providing practical tools for improving health outcomes and healthcare experiences. Through culturally responsive programming, meaningful community partnerships, and the development of accessible resources, this initiative contributes to broader health equity efforts while addressing immediate needs within Toronto's Somali community.
